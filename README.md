## 🛠 Technical Skills

I have strong programming skills in **Python, JavaScript, and SQL**.  
In **Full Stack Development**, I can build modern web applications using **React.js, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap** for frontend, and **Node.js, Express.js, or PHP** for backend. I am experienced in working with **MongoDB and MySQL databases**, and developing **REST APIs** for seamless data integration.  

In **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**, I am familiar with supervised and unsupervised learning, neural networks, and convolutional neural networks (CNN) using **TensorFlow and Keras**. I also have experience in **computer vision**, including **face detection (MTCNN), posture detection (PoseNet), and image classification**.  

For **data analysis and visualization**, I use **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Power BI**. I am also comfortable with version control and collaboration using **Git and GitHub**.
